# Vivino-Automation

Framewor and Approach:

I have used BDD cucumber with Page object model. All the pages and step definition classses are divided.

How to Run:
===========

Run npm i (to install all node depenedencies)

Execute with keyword: --> ./node_modules/.bin/cypress-tags run -e TAGS='@testing'

If you want to execute with executition tray, first open cypress tray and run feature file.

Comment is mention for easiness to understand. All the screnshot and video evidence is available for successfully executed test cases.

Feel free to reach out to me in case of any query. Thanks
